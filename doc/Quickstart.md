# Quickstarting DAPHNE

These reduced instructions should get you started by firing up a hello world script from the latest binary release. 

### The recipe is as follows:

1. Download and extract daphne-<version>-bin.tgz from the [release page](https://github.com/daphne-eu/daphne/releases).
Optionally choose the daphne-cuda-<version>-bin.tgz archive if you want to run DAPHNE with CUDA support (Nvidia Pascal 
hardware or newer and an installed CUDA SDK are required)
2. In a bash (or compatible) shell, from the extracted DAPHNE directory, execute this command
    ```bash
    ./run-daphne.sh scripts/examples/hello-world.daph
   ````
   Optionally you can activate CUDA ops by including --cuda:
   ```bash 
    ./run-daphne.sh --cuda scripts/examples/hello-world.daph
    ```
   
   Earning extra points: To see one level of intermediate representation that the DAPHNE compiler generates in its wealth 
of optimization passes run with the explain flag
   ```bash 
    ./run-daphne.sh --explain=kernels scripts/examples/hello-world.daph
    ```

### Explanation

The ``run-daphne.sh`` script sets up the required environment (so your system's shared library loader finds the required 
.so files) and passes the provided parameters to the daphne executable. 

Interesting things to look at:
* file ``run-daphne.sh``
* file ``UserConfig.json``
* file ``scripts/examples/hello-world.daph``
* output of ``run-daphne.sh --help``
